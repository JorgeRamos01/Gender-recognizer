# Gender-recognizer
Algorithms to detect patrons in faces to recognize gender

To find faces inside pictures is used a Haar Cascade, after this the faces are cutted and resized.

The algorithms in R, provide distance functions (euclidean, correlations), costs functions and the main algorithm for NonNegative
Matrix Factorization in a local and a global framework and are compared with PCA results.
